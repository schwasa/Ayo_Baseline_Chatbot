  utter_fac_disclosure:
    - text: "Did you already tell someone?"

  utter_fac_disclosure_yes:
    - text: "So, how was the reaction?"

  utter_fac_disclosure_no:
    - text: "Ok, how are your feelings about telling someone?"
  utter_fac_disclosure2:
    - text: "However, I believe that it is relieving to disclose to a close relative, as 
            it helps you to go on with the disease you are living with."
  utter_fac_disclosure_how:
    - text: "Well, to be honest {PERSON}, some people might react negatively. However, telling a trusted person about 
            your infection separates “the friends from the acquaintances”, leaving you with the people you can really 
            trust. However, I recommend you to disclose in small steps, you might want to find out first what they 
            know and how they feel about HIV in general, before revealing your secret."
  utter_fac_adherence_why:
    - text: "Ok, first of all, how are your feelings about taking the medicine?"
  utter_fac_adherence_reachout:
    - text: "So you want to know what to respect when taking the medicine and probably why you should take it so often?"
  utter_fac_adherence_how:
    - text: "Well, the medication blocks the virus to spread within your body, 
            so when you take the medicine every day, you keep the viral load under control. \n\n
            On the other hand, if you don't take the pills every day, the virus will spread and will
            make you sick, that's why it is so important to stick to your prescribed plan."
  utter_fac_contracting_general:
    - text: "Well, probably first the facts about getting infected with HIV, if that's ok for you?"
  utter_fac_contracting_sex:
    - text: "So, you can have Sex being HIV-positive, but need to practice safe sex using condoms. Furthermore
    I recommend talking to your partner and to disclose."
  utter_fac_contracting_kids_mf:
    - text: "Alright, firstly, it depends if you are male or female? In order to advise you correctly
            please give me the sex you were assigned to at birth."
  utter_fac_contracting_kids_feel:
    - text: "Thank you! And now please tell me, if you couldn't have kids, what would that mean for you?"

      text: "If you are a man living with HIV and wish to have children, you need the support and advice 
            of a healthcare provider or a reproductive health counselor experienced with HIV- issues. Meaning:
            you should not have kids straight away and check first what is possible or not with professionals."

            counselling guidance, before getting pregnant."

  utter_faq_explain_HIV:
    - text: "HIV is a virus – an infection with HIV that can make you sick. HIV is passed on from one person to another 
        through:\n\n
        1. Unprotected Sex \n\n
        2. Sharing needles or injecting equipment \n\n
        3. Blood transfusions and organ transplants \n\n
        4. From a mother to her baby during pregnancy, vaginal delivery and breastfeeding \n\n
        Without treatment, HIV damages your immune system. Your immune system is the part of your body that fights 
        infection and protects you from getting sick. When your immune system is damaged you are more likely to get ill."
  utter_faq_contracting_HIV:
    - text: "HIV is passed on from one person to another. The HIV virus can only be passed on through: \n\n
            1. Unprotected Sex \n\n
            2. Sharing needles or injecting equipment \n\n
            3. Blood transfusions and organ transplants \n\n
            4. From a mother to her baby during pregnancy, vagina delivery and breastfeeding"
#  utter_faq_HIV_positive:
#    - text: "If you are unsure whether you are HIV positive or negative, you can take an HIV test at a health center or hospital. \n\n
#    This is usually done by taking blood, which is then tested in a laboratory."
  utter_faq_HIV_vs_AIDS:
    - text: "HIV is not the same thing as AIDS. \n\n
        HIV is the virus that can get passed on to another person. AIDS is a state of sickness that occurs when your 
        body’s immune system is so damaged by HIV, it can’t fight off infections. \n\n
        People who have AIDS will feel sick, whereas people with HIV might not notice anything is wrong. Without 
        treatment AIDS can lead to death. \n\n
        Today, antiretroviral treatment is so good, people living with HIV can live a normal productive life and never 
        feel sick as long as they take their medication regularly."
  utter_faq_HIV_cure:
    - text: "There is no cure for HIV, although antiretroviral treatment can control the virus, meaning that people 
          with HIV can live long and healthy lives. Most research is looking for a functional cure where HIV is reduced 
          to undetectable and harmless levels in the body permanently, but some residual virus may remain. 
          Other research is looking for a sterilising cure where HIV is eradicated from the body completely, but this 
          is more complex and risky. Trials of HIV vaccines are encouraging, but so far offer only partial protection.
          Treatment is the only way to manage HIV and prevent it from damaging your immune system. It also reduces the 
          risk of passing HIV on to your sexual partners."
  utter_faq_HIV_fatal:
    - text: "It is true that people who do not receive treatment for HIV will eventually (over years) become ill and die 
        of complications of HIV infection. With effective treatment (called antiretroviral therapy), however, most 
        people with HIV infection will lead long and healthy lives; this is especially true if they start HIV treatment 
        when their immune system is still relatively strong."
